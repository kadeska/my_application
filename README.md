# My Program

This is my 3D game project created using QT Creator as my IDE. Why QT Creator you might ask, well, because I like the feel of using QT Creator. It offers a cross platform windowing system, plus it has a neat UI tool to build such windows. I use QT creator to make development tools. I can still build my game without the use of QT Creator once its ready for the first release. 

##### story

This is going to be a game about adventure and survival. You wake up lost in a richly dense forest, with some scratches and bruises, as well as what feels like a broken rib.

You have no memory of how you got here, and the only thing you can recall is your name, "Daniel". The forest around you is alive with sounds, birds chirping, leaves rustling, and the distant howl of an unknown creature. The air is damp and heavy, and the ground beneath you is covered in thick moss and decomposing fallen leaves. 

You quickly realize you’ll need to find food, water, and shelter if you’re going to survive. But as you start to explore, you notice strange symbols carved into the trees and a faint trail leading deeper into the woods. You feel a sense of unease, as if you’re being watched.

With limited strength and no supplies, you’ll need to make choices carefully. Do you follow the trail, hoping it leads to help? Or do you stay where you are and try to gather resources to regain your strength?

Every decision matters, and the forest hides secrets that could either save you or destroy you. Can you survive long enough to uncover the truth behind your situation and find a way out?
